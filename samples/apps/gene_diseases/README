This directory contains an example of a Rake pipeline that performs a
particular functionality, finding names of diseases related to a list of
genes. The idea is borrowed from Polysearch
(http://wishart.biology.ualberta.ca/polysearch/ ), as well as the disease
thesaurus, which is included in the standard Rbbt distribution. The pipeline
is exported using a SOAP web server using the simplews support for Rake
pipelines.

Genes must be human and in Entrez Gene id format. To translate ids to Entrez
format see the samples/scripts/translate.rb file. Automatic translation could
be trivially added and is left as an exercise to the reader.

To execute the pipeline by hand do:

# cat gene_ids.txt | rake work/diseases/test

Note that once the file work/diseases/test is produce it will refuse to
produce it again. To try a different list of genes change 'test' for something
more meaningful, or remove the files with '# rm work/*/test'

To try the SOAP web server do:

# ruby SOAP_server.rb &
# cat gene_ids.txt | ruby SOAP_client.rb

To launch the WWW interface do:

# ruby SOAP_server.rb &   # if you haven't before
# ruby WWW_server.rb

a http server should be listening at http://localhost:4567/

For this example to work, you will need the entrez gene_info file, the human
organism information, and the polysearch dictionaries.

# rbbt_config prepare identifiers
# rbbt_config prepare polysearch
# rbbt_config install organisms -o human

Also, you will need to create the directories disease, metadocs, and pmids
that you wish to use.

# mkdir work/diseases work/metadocs work/pmids
