What is Rbbt?
-------------

Rbbt is the "Ruby Bioinformatics Tool-box". It is a framework for software developement in
bioinformatics. It covers three aspects:

* Developing functionalities
* Making the as widely accessible as possible
* Integrating them with one another

What has been Rbbt used for?
----------------------

Rbbt has been used to power several applications, either in their entirety of parts of it (e.g. workflow management):

* [SENT](href="http://sent.dacya.ucm.es/"): semantic features in text
* [BioNMF]("http://bionmf.dacya.ucm.es/"): Non-negative matrix
* [MARQ]("http://marq.dacya.ucm.es/"): microarray-rank
* [Genecodis]("http://genecodis.cnb.csic.es/"): Gene annotation co-ocurrence discovery
* [3DEM Loupe]("http://3demloupe.dacya.ucm.es/"): Normal mode analysis of dynamics of structures from electron microscopy
* [Talasso]("http://talasso.cnb.csic.es/"): Quantification of miRNA-mRNA interactions
* [KinMut]("http://wkinmut.bioinfo.cnio.es/"): Pathogenicity predictions of kinase mutations

It was the development of these applications that guided to design of the
framework to a large extend.

What is it currently used for?
----------------------------

Rbbt has been extended over the last three years to cope with the challenges of
cancer genomics. One of the main addition is the *Entity subsystem*, a novel
approach to functionality integration.

How can I benefit?
------------------

As a user by using the applications that it powers :) As a developer, by taking its code appart, copying the ideas,
stealing shamelessly the implementations, provided you give me credit
